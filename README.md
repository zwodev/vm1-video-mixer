# Home of VM-1

## About
VM-1 is a creative coding tool for live mixing of videos, camera images and generative graphics. It will initially be developed for the widely used and inexpensive Raspberry Pi platform, allowing creative media projects at.

**The pitch:**
Think of it as [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi) for moving images!

## Content
At the moment this repository consists of 2 main parts:

1. A Python-based proof-of-concept demonstrating hardware-accelerated video playback and camera input: [Python](https://github.com/zwodev/vm1-video-mixer/python)

2. A simple C++ based framework that incorportates libraries like SDL, OpenGL and Dear Imgui. This will be used as starting ground for VM-1's development. Besides hardware-accelerated video playback there is nothing much to see at the moment, but feel free to check it out: [C++](https://github.com/zwodev/vm1-video-mixer/cpp)
