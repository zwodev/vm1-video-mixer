# VM-1 / The Video Mixer for Everyone

The VM-1 is an open-source hardware project for live mixing of videos, camera images and generative graphics. It is based on the widely used and affordable Raspberry Pi (5) platform, allowing creative media projects of all sorts.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

You want to build your very own VM-1?! Awesome! This is how you do it:

### 1. Order the Parts
You're lucky! We've prepared a shopping list for you. This is a link to the shopping cart at BerryBase (Berlin, Germany). You don't have to buy the parts there and this is no affiliate link. It's just for your convenience!
This list includes everything you need. If you already own some parts, just delete them from the cart.

### 2. Print your Case
Don't worry, you do not have wildly connect all the parts. We've prepared a neat little housing for your VM-1. You just have to print it on your own, your friend's or your makerspace's 3D-printer. If you have trouble getting your case printed, don't worry and drop us a line.
